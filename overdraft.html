        Overdraft
   </h1>

            An overdraft is an extension of credit from a lending institution that is granted when an account reaches zero. The overdraft allows the account holder to continue withdrawing money even when the account has no funds in it or has insufficient funds to cover the amount of the withdrawal.
        </p>
        <p>
                      Basically, an overdraft means that the bank allows customers to borrow a set amount of money. There is interest on the loan, and there is typically a fee per overdraft. At many banks, an overdraft fee can run upwards of $35.
        </p>
        <h4>
           # How an Overdraft Works ?
        </h4>
        <p>
            With an overdraft account, a bank is covering payments a customer has made that would otherwise be rejected, or in the case of actual checks, would bounce and be returned without payment.          
        </p>
        <p>
            As with any loan, the borrower pays interest on the outstanding balance of an overdraft loan. Often, the interest on the loan is lower than the interest on credit cards, making the overdraft a better short-term option in an emergency. In many cases, there are additional fees for using overdraft protection that reduce the amount available to cover your checks, such as insufficient funds fees per check or withdrawal.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                An overdraft is flexible - you only borrow what you need at the time which may make it cheaper than a loan.

                It's quick to arrange.

            <li>
                There is not normally a charge for paying off the overdraft earlier than expected.
