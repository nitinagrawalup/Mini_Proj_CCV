        Bank Deposits

            Bank deposits consist of money placed into banking institutions for safekeeping. These deposits are made to deposit accounts such as savings accounts, checking accounts and money market accounts. The account holder has the right to withdraw deposited funds, as set forth in the terms and conditions governing the account agreement.
        </p>
        <h3>
            # How Bank Deposits Work
        </h3>
        <p>
            The deposit itself is a liability owed by the bank to the depositor. Bank deposits refer to this liability rather than to the actual funds that have been deposited. When someone opens a bank account and makes a cash deposit, he surrenders the legal title to the cash, and it becomes an asset of the bank. In turn, the account is a liability to the bank.
        </p>
        <h3>
          # Types of Bank Deposits
        </h3>
        <h4>
            1. Current Account/Demand Deposit Account
        </h4>
        <p>
            A current account, also called a demand deposit account, is a basic checking account. Consumers deposit money and the deposited money can be withdrawn as the account holder desires on demand. These accounts often allow the account holder to withdraw funds using bank cards, checks or over-the-counter withdrawal slips. In some cases, banks charge monthly fees for current accounts, but they may waive the fee if the account holder meets other requirements such as setting up direct deposit or making a certain number of monthly transfers to a savings account.
        </p>
        <h4>
            2. Savings Accounts
        </h4>
        <p>
            Savings accounts offer account holders interest on their deposits. However, in some cases, account holders may incur a monthly fee if they do not maintain a set balance or a certain number of deposits. Although savings accounts are not linked to paper checks or cards like current accounts, their funds are relatively easy for account holders to access.


        </p>
        <p>
            In contrast, a money market account offers slightly higher interest rates than a savings account, but account holders face more limitations on the number of checks or transfers they can make from money market accounts.


        </p>
        <h4>
            3. Call Deposit Accounts
        </h4>
        <p>
            Financial institutions refer to these accounts as interest-bearing checking accounts, Checking Plus or Advantage Accounts. These accounts combine the features of checking and savings accounts, allowing consumers to easily access their money but also earn interest on their deposits.


        </p>
        <h4>
            4. Special Considerations

        </h4>
        <p>
            The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) provides deposit insurance that guarantees the deposits of member banks for at least $250,000 per depositor, per bank.


        </p>
        <p>
            Member banks are required to place signs visible to the public stating that "deposits are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States Government."

                    The aim of our is to provide security and confidence in the economy. If banks were allowed to go bankrupt and consumers lost savings; it would cause widespread financial panic and many consumers would withdraw their savings and hold as cash.
