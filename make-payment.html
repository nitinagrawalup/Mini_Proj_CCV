       Bank Payments
   </h1>
   <hr width="80%">
   <div class="container">
        <p>
            Unsurprisingly, offering your customers more ways to pay you back results in faster payments. Fortunately, there are more payment options than ever before to offer your customers, including bank payments. Here are just a few of the perks you get by letting your customers pay you with bank payments.
        </p>
        <p>
            Bank payments enable even easier transfers between accounts, making payments easy to send (for customers) and easy to accept (for business owners). The whole new galaxy of digital payment solutions provides more options and more flexibility than your good ol’ fashioned cash and checks. With all of these new options, it can get a little overwhelming for a small business owner to gauge which solutions are right for them. After all, some require expensive hardware, others come with hefty transaction fees, and still others require ongoing subscription charges that can add up over time.
        </p>
        <p>Despite the potential costs, these systems ultimately enable entrepreneurs to receive payments faster and more conveniently, keep better track of their transactions, and even allow them to stay open for business when they’re fast asleep. The convenience and quickness of payments coming in often surpass the small upfront cost of accepting payments online.
        </p>
        <h4>
            #How do bank payments work?
        </h4>
        <p>
            Bank payments work just like paper checks, but in a faster, more secure way. Customers pay online right from your invoice, but instead of a physical check making its way from your customer’s hands to yours through snail mail, everything happens electronically via the Automated Clearing House (ACH)—the industry standard network for handling financial transactions—which verifies your customer’s identity and banking information and clears the money to be deposited into your account.


        </p>
        <p>When customers pay by paper check, it can sometimes be weeks before your hard-earned cash makes its way into your bank account. You lose a lot of time to snail mail and processing while your check hangs in limbo.



        </p>
        <p>
            None of that happens with bank payments. Your customers pay you right from your invoices, and Wave automates the rest of the payment process so you receive your money in just a few days. The best part—no money goes missing, and there are no accidental charges.


        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>
            Different types of money transfer supported:
        </h3>
        <h4>
            1. NEFT (National Electronic Fund Transfer)
        </h4>
        <p>
            The National Electronic Fund Transfer or NEFT is the simplest and most liked form of money transfer from one bank to bank.
        </p>
        <p>
            To make any NEFT transaction, you just need two important pieces of information -- firstly, account number and secondly, the IFSC Code of the destination account.          
        </p>
        <p>
            In NEFT, there is no cap on the amount of money that can be transferred. However, individual banks may set a limit.
        </p>
        <h4>
            2. RTGS (Real Time Gross Settlement)
        </h4>
        <p>
            A Real Time Gross Settlement or RTGS is almost similar to NEFT but the minimum payment and how it credits to the destination account differs.

        </p>
        <p>
            If you want to transfer more than 2 then you can use this. There is no upper cap on the amount.
        </p>
        <p>
            An RTGS money transfer happens on a real-time basis. The bank of the person to whom the money is transferred gets 30 minutes to credit it to his/her account.
        </p>
        <h4>
            3. IMPS (Immediate Payment Service)
        </h4>
        <p>
            Immediate Payment Service or IMPs an instant fund transfer service and it can be used anytime. IMPS can be simply defined as NEFT+RTGS.
        </p>
        <p>
            In order to avoid fraud complaints, the cap on transaction limit is set very low. For IMPS transfer, you just need to know the destination account holder's IMPS id (MMID) and his/her mobile number.
        </p>
        <h4>
            4. UPI (Unified Payments Interface):
        </h4>
        <p>
            A Unified Payments Interface is a real-time payment system that allows transactions to be done through any smartphone using VPA (Virtual Payment Address).
        </p>
        <p>No bank account detail is needed for the money transfer through UPI. Only mobile number or name is sufficient and the transactions can be done 24/7. UPI-enabled apps allow the transfers up to Rs 1 lakh.
